Lasso is a little game written in Python 3 and JavaScript. Make loops around the
objects and other players, but don't touch them! Don't move too fast or your
tail will break.

To use this, install aiohttp using pip3 and run server.py. You can then go to
localhost:5050 in a web browser and make some loops.
